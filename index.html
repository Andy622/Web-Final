        <p id="homepar">This is the home page for our product EZGuitar. EZGuitar is a product to help anyone learn how to play the guitar.
                It is made to stream bluetooth with your phone or computer any song you would like to play. The neck of the guitar
                is made with lights under the string that light up when the string needs to be played. Our product is a guitar its self
                so there is no reason to go buy another guitar like with Guitar Hero and RockBand. EZGuitar is battery operated so you can 
                pick it up and play it anywhere, no more being strapped to a console or stuck watching slow youtube videos.
